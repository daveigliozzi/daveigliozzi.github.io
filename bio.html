			<h1>David's Biography</h1>
			<p> Oh, hello there. I didn't notice that you had come in.<br/>
				Come in, take a seat. Let me tell you a little about myself.
			<p/>
			<p>
				Four score and fourteen seconds ago I was born in a burrow underneath the Brooklyn Brige. I was 8lbs, 6oz and was born with a tail and a natural ability to guess how far away the nearest Starbucks is (0.2 miles from where you're sitting). 
			</p>
			<p>
				I had a normal childhood, nothing out of the ordinary. My mother was a Martian immigrant and my father was the son of a shepard. I had three siblings. All are centaurs.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently a student at Tufts University. I am majoring in Human Factors Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I will be graduating in the spring of 2015.
